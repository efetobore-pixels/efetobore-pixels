    <p>This Avatar is a reflection of life, past experiences, and present reality. It reflects fear, worries, challenges faced and overcome, as well as the uncertainty of the future. It serves as a reminder to focus on what can be controlled and not to worry about what can't be. For the storm will come but last only for a while; joy comes in the morning. This is expressed through a collection of code with a <strong>touch</strong> of interactivity.</p>
